description: While building my Astro-powered site, I wanted an easy way to
  manage content without digging through markdown files every time. I discovered
  Decap CMS, a Git-based content management system that integrates smoothly with
  static sites. In this post, I walk through the setup process, configuration
  steps, and how it transformed my blog workflow by enabling real-time editing â€”
  no build process required!
